->First we will store score for all the blocks if required data mets with blocks given data.
if its true then increase score of that particular apartment
->now we have to find max score and and block of that max score
once we find that max score we set it in nearestBlockScore and we get nearestBlock

After iterating throughout the blocks if nearestBlock is still 0
then we find other block who satisfy the condition and assign them a score
